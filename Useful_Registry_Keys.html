   +-Wine
      |
      +-AppDefaults
      |  |
      |  +-*&lt;app.exe&gt;
      |       [Application specific defaults. Replace app.exe with the name of the
      |        application you want to override defaults for. And use the same subtrees
      |        as the Wine subtree (i.e. DllOverrides, X11 Driver, etc.).]
      |
      +-Debug
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;RelayExclude
      |  |   [Use this key to exclude some calls from the (overwhelming) +relay debug logging. Example:
      |  |    "RelayExclude"="ntdll.RtlEnterCriticalSection;ntdll.RtlLeaveCriticalSection"]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;RelayFromExclude
      |  |   [Exclude calls made from listed dlls in the the +relay debug log. Example:
      |  |    "RelayFromExclude"="kernel32" - omit all calls made from kernel32.dll]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;SpyExclude
      |  |   [Exclude listed messages from the +message debug log. Example:
      |  |    "SpyExclude"="WM_TIMER;WM_MOUSEMOVE;WM_PAINT"]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;SpyInclude
      |      [Include only listed messages in the +message debug log. Example:
      |       "SpyInclude"="WM_CREATE"]
      |
      +-Direct2D
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;max_version_factory
      |      [DWORD Value (REG_DWORD): Limit the maximum supported Direct2D factory version.]
      |
      +-Direct3D
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;CheckFloatConstants
      |  |   [Range check float constants in d3d9 shaders. Use this to workaround
      |  |    application bugs like https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34052,
      |  |    usually resulting in geometry glitches. Enabling this has a small performance
      |  |    impact, default is disabled.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;csmt
      |  |   [DWORD Value (REG_DWORD): Enable (0x1, default) or disable (0x0) the multi-threaded
      |  |    command stream feature. This serialises rendering commands from different threads into
      |  |    a single rendering thread, in order to avoid the excessive synchronisation that would otherwise
      |  |    be required for correct rendering. This superseded the old "StrictDrawOrdering" setting.
      |  |    Introduced in Wine 2.6.
      |  |    Starting with Wine 6.0-rc1 this value is a bitmask, with bit 1 forcing serialisation
      |  |    of OpenGL or Vulkan commands between multiple command streams in the same application.
      |  |    This can be useful for applications using d3d from multiple threads, like MS Office 2013+,
      |  |    on drivers that are buggy in this regard, like Nouveau (as of the end of 2020). To enable this
      |  |    functionality you would set the registry key to 0x3, to enable both the command stream and the
      |  |    command serialisation.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;MaxShaderModelCS
      |  |   [DWORD Value (REG_DWORD): Limit the maximum supported shader model for compute shaders.
      |  |    Set to 0 to disable support for compute shaders.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;MaxShaderModelDS
      |  |   [DWORD Value (REG_DWORD): Limit the maximum supported shader model for domain shaders.
      |  |    Set to 0 to disable support for domain shaders.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;MaxShaderModelGS
      |  |   [DWORD Value (REG_DWORD): Limit the maximum supported shader model for geometry shaders.
      |  |    Set to 0 to disable support for geometry shaders.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;MaxShaderModelHS
      |  |   [DWORD Value (REG_DWORD): Limit the maximum supported shader model for hull shaders.
      |  |    Set to 0 to disable support for hull shaders.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;MaxShaderModelPS
      |  |   [DWORD Value (REG_DWORD): Limit the maximum supported shader model for pixel shaders.
      |  |    Set to 0 to disable support for pixel shaders.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;MaxShaderModelVS
      |  |   [DWORD Value (REG_DWORD): Limit the maximum supported shader model for vertex shaders.
      |  |    Set to 0 to disable support for vertex shaders.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;MaxVersionGL
      |  |   [DWORD Value (REG_DWORD): Choose the maximum OpenGL version to request.
      |  |    Defaults to OpenGL version 4.4 since Wine 3.9 (except for Nvidia GPUs where the default only changed with Wine 3.18).
      |  |    Set it to 30002 (hexadecimal) or greater to request a core profile context.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;MultisampleTextures
      |  |   [DWORD Value (REG_DWORD): Enable (0x1, default) or disable (0x0) multisample textures.
      |  |    If multisample textures are disabled, renderbuffers are used for multisampling.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;OffscreenRenderingMode
      |  |   [Select the offscreen rendering implementation.
      |  |        backbuffer - Render offscreen render targets in the backbuffer
      |  |        fbo - Use framebuffer objects for offscreen rendering (default)]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;renderer
      |  |   [Select what backend to use for wined3d. Valid options are:
      |  |        gdi
      |  |        gl
      |  |        vulkan
      |  |    The "gdi" option (and its alias "no3d") mostly exists for legacy or test reasons.
      |  |     As of Wine 5.1, gl is the default and vulkan is still work in progress,
      |  |     so don't expect great results with it yet.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;SampleCount
      |  |   [DWORD Value (REG_DWORD): Override swapchain sample count. It can be used to force enable multisampling
      |  |    with applications that otherwise don't support it, like the similar control panel setting
      |  |    available with some GPU drivers. This one might work in more cases than the driver setting though.
      |  |    Not all applications are compatible with this setting.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;shader_backend
      |  |   [Valid options are:
      |  |        glsl
      |  |        arb
      |  |        none
      |  |    If not set, and UseGLSL is not set to "disabled", the shader backend will be determined automatically,
      |  |     with preference going to glsl.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;strict_shader_math
      |  |   [DWORD Value (REG_DWORD): Enable (0x1) or disable (0x0, default)
      |  |    generation of NVIDIA specific pragma in GLSL shader code to
      |  |    turn off aggressive optimization of the shader code by the driver.
      |  |    Use this to workaround bugs like https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35207,
      |  |    usually resulting in incorrect rendering of some objects which is
      |  |    reproducible on NVIDIA GPU with proprietary driver only.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;UseGLSL
      |  |   [When set to "disabled", this disables the use of GLSL for shaders.
      |  |    In general disabling GLSL is not recommended, only use this for debugging purposes.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;VideoMemorySize
      |  |   [Set the amount of reported video memory (in megabytes). By default Wine will use 
      |  |    GLX_MESA_query_renderer to determine the amount of video memory on the graphics
      |  |    card. On (mostly proprietary) drivers not supporting GLX_MESA_query_renderer, Wine
      |  |    will instead estimate the amount of video memory based on the card's PCI IDs. The
      |  |    The "VideoMemorySize" setting allows the value determined by Wine to be overridden.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;VideoPciDeviceID
      |  |   [DWORD Value (REG_DWORD): Set the PCI device ID of the graphics card. See "VideoPciVendorID".]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;VideoPciVendorID
      |  |   [DWORD Value (REG_DWORD): Set the PCI vendor ID of the graphics card. By default
      |  |    Wine wil use GLX_MESA_query_renderer to determine the PCI IDs of the graphics card.
      |  |    On (mostly proprietary) drivers not supporting GLX_MESA_query_renderer, Wine will
      |  |    instead try to pick an appropriate set of PCI IDs based on the OpenGL GL_RENDERER,
      |  |    GL_VENDOR, and GL_EXTENSIONS strings. The "VideoPciVendorID" and "VideoPciDeviceID"
      |  |    settings allow the values determined by Wine to be overridden. For most applications
      |  |    there should be little reason to touch these settings, but there exists a limited set of
      |  |    applications that will choose a broken code path based on the PCI IDs. Note that only
      |  |    combinations listed in wined3d's gpu_description_table[] are valid here.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;WineLogo
      |  |   [Path to image file to use as logo for Wine.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;AlwaysOffscreen
      |  |   [REMOVED in Wine 2.1.
      |  |    Use offscreen rendering for all render targets. The main effect this has is
      |  |    avoiding the depth buffer copy between offscreen and onscreen targets, which
      |  |    introduces fallbacks in some drivers and exposes bugs in others. There may be a
      |  |    performance hit depending on the specific driver.
      |  |    Enabled by default since Wine 1.5.10.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;DirectDrawRenderer
      |  |   [REMOVED in Wine 5.1.
      |  |    Select what backend to use for wined3d. Valid options are:
      |  |        gdi - Use GDI to draw on the screen
      |  |        opengl - Use OpenGL (default)
      |  |    The "gdi" option mostly exists for legacy or test reasons.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;Multisampling
      |  |   [REMOVED in Wine 2.7.
      |  |    Set to "disabled" to prevent applications from seeing Wine's multisampling support.]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;StrictDrawOrdering
      |      [REMOVED in Wine 3.5.
      |       This option ensures any pending drawing operations are submitted to the driver, but at
      |       a significant performance cost. Set to "enabled" to enable. This setting was deprecated
      |       since Wine 2.6. Use "csmt" instead.]
      |
      +-DirectInput
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;MouseWarpOverride
      |  |   [Override default mouse pointer warping behavior:
      |  |    enable:  (default) warp pointer when mouse exclusively acquired
      |  |    disable: never warp the mouse pointer
      |  |    force:   always warp the pointer]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;*&lt;joystick name&gt; = &lt;axes mapping&gt;
      |  |   [This maps axes of joystick "joystick name". The "axes mapping" is
      |  |    comma-separated list of "axis type"s - one for each joystick axis (hat-pov uses 2 axes).
      |  |    "axis type" is one of: X, Y, Z, Rx, Ry, Rz, Slider1, Slider2, POV1, POV2, POV3, POV4.
      |  |    To find the joystick name run
      |  |    'WINEDEBUG=+dinput wine game.exe 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep joydev_enum_device'
      |  |    Example output: trace:dinput:joydev_enum_deviceW Enumerating the linux Joystick device: /dev/input/js0 (Logitech Logitech Dual Action)
      |  |    Example registry entry: "Logitech Logitech Dual Action"="X,Y,Rz,Slider1,POV1". (two "Logitech"s not a typo)]
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;DefaultDeadZone
      |  |   [Sets a default value for every joystick axis dead zone. Should be a value between 0 and 10000.
      |  |    The value represents the percentage of the axis which will seen as dead (applications will think of it as being centered).
      |  |    For example 3000 will extend the dead zone to only the first 30% of the axis, while 0 will use the whole axis extension.]
      |  |
      +-DirectSound
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;HelBuflen
      |       Hardware emulation buffer length - default is 65536
      |
      +-Drivers
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;Audio
      |  |    Which audio backend to use. Should be a string such as "pulse" or "alsa" or "oss" or "coreaudio".
      |  |    Set to the empty string to disable audio entirely. Given a comma-separated list of
      |  |    drivers, Wine will attempt to make the most appropriate choice.
      |  |
      |  +-winealsa.drv
      |  |  |
      |  |  +-&gt;ALSAOutputDevices (REG_MULTI_SZ, "Multi String Value")
      |  |  |    A list of auxiliary output devices, not enumerated by ALSA's hardware enumeration
      |  |  |    methods. For example, you might put software devices here.
      |  |  |
      |  |  +-&gt;ALSAInputDevices (REG_MULTI_SZ, "Multi String Value")
      |  |       A list of auxiliary input devices, not enumerated by ALSA's hardware enumeration
      |  |       methods.

      |  +-&gt;Graphics
      |       Which graphic driver to use.
      |       mac: Use the native quartz driver (default on macOS)
      |       x11: Use the X11 driver
      |       null: Use the null driver (a virtual screen will be created, but not displayed; available since Wine 5.2)
      |
      +-Explorer
      |  |
      |  +-&gt;Desktop
      |  |   [Title of the virtual desktop window. The special value "shell" also causes the shell
      |  |    to be displayed, if the EnableShell value is not present (see below).]
      |  |
      |  +-Desktops

      |        match both www.winehq.org and wiki.winehq.org). To limit compatibility mode to IE10 for all
      |        Wine web pages, create .winehq.org subkey and set its MaxCompatMode value to "10".]
